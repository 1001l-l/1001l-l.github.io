cubingmadeeasy.github.io/cubing-made-easy/ is a free website to help you further your understanding of twisty puzzles. If you've never solved a Rubik's Cube you should stick to the video tutorials at the bottom of the page. Credit to @JPerm on youtube for the tutorials. I will be coming out with my own tutorials SUNE!
