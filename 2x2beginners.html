<h1>2x2 Tutorial</h1>
<p>The 2x2 is considered the easiest puzzle to solve, so I have compiled the easiest tutorial on the internet. You will need to start by learning cube notation. 
This is the hardest part of the process of solving, however it's not all that bad. Don't give up, you will get it eventually!</p>
<p>Start by memorizing the letters of the faces.
"U" is "up", "D" is "down", "F" is "front", "B" is "back", "R" is "right", "L" is "Left".</p>
<p>Go to the face that the letter represents and turn it clockwise.</p>
<p>If you see an apostrophe next to the letter, just do the move backwards. That's it!</p>
<p>Now that you know that, you can move on to the first layer.</p>
<h1>First Layer</h1>
<p>To achieve this step you will need to learn the series of moves I am about to show you.</p>
<p>The series of moves is "R" "U" "R'" "U'"</p>
<p>Practice this until you know it well.</p>
<p>Now that you have that down, look for any corners that have white on them.</p>
<p>Find one white corner you like, and place it on the "front" "bottom" "left" of the cube.</p>
<p>Now find another white corner and move it to the "top" "front" "right" of the cube.</p>
<p>Now simply repeat the moves you learned earlier. If you need reminding, the moves were "R" "U" "R'" "U'"</p>
<p> Repeat these moves until the two white pieces pair to make a line of white.</p>
<p>Now repeat this step to the other white corners. Just remember to move the corners you've already solved to the bottom left before you do the move we just learned.</p>
<h1>Last Layer</h1>
<p>The last layer is the last step of a 2x2.</p>
<p>Start by flipping the cube over so that white is on top.</p>
<p>Now, just repeat the same algorithm we learned earlier until the yellow sticker on the "front", "bottom", "right" faces the bottom.</p>
<p>If you pay attention, the cube looks scrambled now. But don't worry, we'll fix it later.</p>
<p>Once the yellow sticker faces the bottom, do a "D" or a "D'" move to put another yellow corner in the "front" "bottom" "right" of the cube. Don't try to move the cube in your hands to put a yellow corner on the "front" "bottom" "right".</p>
<p>If you do that it will mess the cube up all over again.</p>
<p>Repeat this process for all four corners until the last layer is solved.</p>
<p>After you are finished, all you need to do is a "U", "U'", or a "U2". (that just means to do a "U" move twice!)</p>
<p>If you don't have a solved cube, turn the top layer so that the most side corners are solved. Then do this algorithm: "R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'".</p>
<p>If your cube is still not solved, do a "U2" and then repeat the long algorithm I just showed you.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>If you have trouble with this tutorial, I recommend watching JPerm's tutorial that I have Imbeded below.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed this tutorial or it helped you out, let me know.</p>
<p>This website took me over 6 months to complete, so I really hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>Congrats on your first 2x2 solve!</p>
